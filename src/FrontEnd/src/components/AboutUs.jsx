              Hey there, I'm Auralea, people call me Chika! I'm currently cruising through my sophomore year, majoring in Informatics Engineering at Institut Teknologi Bandung. When I'm not coding, you'll catch me jet-setting around the globeâ€”traveling is my heartbeat. I'm currently interested in front-end web development, and still learning and exploring the vast world of webdev. Besides web development, I would also like to dive into the world of artificial intelligence as I have always been curious about how it works.
